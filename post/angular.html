<h2 id="angular-in-action">Angular in Action</h2>
<h2 id="1-angular-a-modern-web-platform">1 Angular: a modern web platform</h2>
<h3 id="angular-a-platform-not-a-framework">Angular: a platform, not a framework</h3>
<ul>
<li>Angular comes with a leaner core library and makes additional features available as separate packages that can be used as needed. It also has many tools that push it beyond a simple framework, including the following:<ul>
<li>Dedicated CLI for application development, testing, and deployment</li>
<li>Of&#xFB02;ine rendering capabilities on many back-end server platforms</li>
<li>Desktop-, mobile-, and browser-based application execution environments</li>
<li>Comprehensive UI component libraries, such as Material Design</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Angular CLI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The CLI has a number of features that aid in the development of Angular apps. Here are the primary features:<ul>
<li>Generates new project scaffolding&#x2014;Instead of having to create a new project from an existing project or creating all the files yourself, the CLI will generate a full project with a basic app already started for you.</li>
<li>Generates new application pieces&#x2014;Need a new component? Easy; it can generate the files for you. It can generate components, services, routes, and pipes, and it also will automatically ensure they are fully wired up in the build process.</li>
<li>Manages the entire build toolchain&#x2014;Because files need to be processed before being served to the client (such as TypeScript compilation), the CLI will process your source files and build them into an optimized version for development or production.</li>
<li>Serves a localhost development server&#x2014;The CLI handles the build &#xFB02;ow and then starts a server listening on localhost so you can see the results, with a live reload feature. </li>
<li>Incorporates code linting and formatting code&#x2014;Helps enforce quality code by using the CLI to lint your code for style and semantic errors, and it can also help format your code automatically to the style rules.</li>
<li>Supports running unit and e2e tests&#x2014;Tests are vital, so the CLI sets up Karma for running your unit tests and works with Protractor to execute your e2e tests. It will automatically pick up and execute new tests as they&#x2019;re generated. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Server rendering and the compiler</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A few primary use cases: <ul>
<li>Server rendering for faster loading&#x2014;Mobile devices are the primary way to access the internet these days, and mobile connections are frequently slow and unreliable. A server-side rendering option allows you to resolve data bindings and render components on the server so the initial payload sent to the user is pre-initialized. It can also optimize and send the necessary bytes for a quick initial load time and lazy load the other assets as needed.</li>
<li>Performance in the browser&#x2014;One of the major pain points of JavaScript is that it&#x2019;s single threaded, which means that JavaScript can only handle one instruction at a time. In modern browsers, a newer technology known as web workers allows Angular to push some of the execution of the compiler into another process. This means that a lot more processing can occur, and it allows things like animations and user interactions to be smoother. </li>
<li>SEO&#x2014;There&#x2019;s a major concern about how heavy JavaScript applications are crawled by search engines. Universal rendering means we can detect crawlers and render the site for them so that content is ready without having to worry if the crawler executes JavaScript (some do, some don&#x2019;t). This will certainly enhance SEO efforts for Angular applications.</li>
<li>Multiple platforms&#x2014;Many developers want to use other platforms for their back ends, such as .NET or PHP. Angular can be compiled in the platform of choice, assuming there&#x2019;s a supported renderer. Angular will provide support for NodeJS, but the community is actively building and maintaining rendering support for other platforms such as Java and Go. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="component-architecture">Component architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li>A component is a way to create custom HTML elements in your application. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Components&apos; key characteristics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Components have some concepts that drive their design and architecture:<ul>
<li>Encapsulation&#x2014;Keeping component logic in a single place</li>
<li>Isolation&#x2014;Keeping component internals hidden from external actors</li>
<li>Reusability&#x2014;Allowing component reuse with minimal effort</li>
<li>Evented&#x2014;Emitting events during the lifecycle of the component</li>
<li>Customizable&#x2014;Making it possible to style and extend the component</li>
<li>Declarative&#x2014;Using a component with simple declarative markup </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several standards are required in order to implement the full vision of web components: <ul>
<li>Custom elements (encapsulation, declarative, reusability, evented)</li>
<li>Shadow DOM (isolation, encapsulation, customizable)</li>
<li>Templates (encapsulation, isolation)</li>
<li>JavaScript modules (encapsulation, isolation, reusability) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Custom Elements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>HTML is the language of the web because it describes the content of a page in a fairly concise set of elements. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The offcial specification for custom elements is intended to allow developers to create new HTML elements that essentially blend naturally and natively into the DOM. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Every Angular component is a custom element and fulfills the four tenets (and more) that we expect to get from a custom element. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shadow DOM</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Shadow DOM is an isolated Document Object Model (DOM) tree that&#x2019;s detached from the typical CSS inheritance, allowing you to create a barrier between markup inside and outside of the Shadow DOM. For example, if you have a button inside of a Shadow DOM and a button outside, any CSS for the button written outside the Shadow DOM won&#x2019;t affect the button inside it. </p>

<li><p>The CSS selector is the only way to limit which elements receive that particular styling. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Shadow DOM enables the best form of encapsulation available in the browser for styles and templates. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Templates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Templates are often used with the Shadow DOM because it allows you to define the template and then inject it into the shadow root. Without templates, the Shadow DOM APIs would require us to inject content node by node. They&#x2019;re also used by Angular as part of the lifecycle of components and the compilation process, allowing Angular to keep isolated, inert copies of the template as data changes and needs to be recompiled. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JavaScript modules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Previously, developers had to build a bundle of all the assets for the web application ahead of time and deliver the whole package to the user. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modern-javascript-and-angular">Modern JavaScript and Angular</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Decorators</li>
<li>Modules</li>
<li>Template literals </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observables</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>observables are a newer pattern for JavaScript applications to manage asynchronous activities.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Promises have a major limitation in that they&#x2019;re only useful for one call cycle. </p>
</li>
<li><p>To use observables, you subscribe to the stream of data and pass a function that will run every time there&#x2019;s a new piece of data.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="typescript-and-angular">TypeScript and Angular</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The basic value proposition of TypeScript is it can force restrictions on what types of values variables hold. </p>
</li>
<li><p>TypeScript can help catch many simple syntax errors before they affect your application. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Here are the primary reasons to use TypeScript:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds clarity to your code&#x2014;Variables that have types are easier to understand, because other developers (or yourself in six months) don&#x2019;t have to think very hard about what the variable should be. </li>
<li>Enables a smarter editor&#x2014;When you use TypeScript with a supported editor, you&#x2019;ll get automatic IntelliSense support for your code. As you write, the editor can suggest known variables or functions and tell you what type of value it expects.</li>
<li>Catches errors before you run code&#x2014;TypeScript will catch syntax errors before you run the code in the browser, helping to reduce the feedback loop when you write invalid code.</li>
<li>Entirely optional&#x2014;You can use types when you want, and optionally leave them out where it doesn&#x2019;t matter. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Angular is a platform, with many key elements such as tooling, UI libraries, and testing built in or easily incorporated into your application projects.</li>
<li>Applications are essentially combinations of components. These components build upon the core principles of encapsulation, isolation, and reusability, which should have events, be customizable, and be declarative.</li>
<li>ES6 and TypeScript provide a lot of the underpinnings for Angular&#x2019;s architecture and syntax, making it a powerful framework without having to build a lot of custom language capabilities. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-building-your-first-angular-app">2 Building your first Angular app</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrapping the app&#x2014;To start the app, we&#x2019;ll use the bootstrap feature to kick things off once they&#x2019;re loaded. This happens once during the app lifecycle, and we&#x2019;ll bootstrap the App component.</li>
<li>Creating components&#x2014;Angular is all about components, and we&#x2019;ll create several components for different purposes. We&#x2019;ll learn about how they&#x2019;re built and how they nest to create complex applications.</li>
<li>Creating services and using HttpClient&#x2014;For code reuse, we&#x2019;ll encapsulate some logic that helps manage the list of stocks into a service and also uses the HttpClient service from Angular to load stock quote data.</li>
<li>Using pipes and directives in templates&#x2014;Using pipes, we can transform data from one format into another during display, such as formatting a timestamp into a local date format. Directives are useful tools to modify the behavior of DOM elements inside a template, such as the ability to repeat pieces or conditionally show elements.</li>
<li>Setting up routing&#x2014;Most applications need the ability to allow users to navigate around the application, and by using the router we can see how to route between different components. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-angular-renders-the-base-application">How Angular renders the base application</h3>
<p><strong>App component</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The @Component annotation declares that this class is a component by accepting an object. It has a selector property that declares the HTML selector of the component.
That means the component is used in the template by adding an HTML tag <code>&lt;app-root&gt; &lt;/app-root&gt;</code>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The templateUrl property declares a link to a template containing an HTML template. Likewise, the styleUrls property contains an array of links to any CSS files that should be loaded for this component.</p>
</li>
<li><p>, This is called interpolation and is frequently used to display data in a template. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>App module</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The App module is the packaging that helps tell Angular what&#x2019;s available to render. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The NgModule decorator takes an object with a few different properties. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The declarations property is to provide a list of any components and directives to make available to the entire application. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The imports property is an array of other modules upon which this module depends </p>
</li>
<li><p>The providers property, which is empty by default. Any services that are created are to be listed here </p>
</li>
<li><p>The bootstrap property defines which components to bootstrap at runtime. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping the app</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The application must be bootstrapped at runtime to start the process of rendering. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The role of main.ts is to bootstrap the Angular application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The platformBrowserDynamic object is used to tell Angular which module is being loading</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can take a moment for all the assets to load and initialize before the component renders. this is known as Just in Time compilation (JiT) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-services">Building services</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Services are objects that abstract some common logic that you plan to reuse in multiple places.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Another way to think of services is as sharable objects that any part of your app can import as needed. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The intention of a service is to enable reuse of code. A service might be a set of common methods that need to be shared. You could have various &#x201C;helper methods&#x201D; that you don&#x2019;t want to write over and over, such as utilities to parse data formats or authentication logic that needs to be run in multiple places. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-your-first-component">Creating your first component</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Directives allow you to modify the behavior and display of DOM elements in a template.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Directives make it possible to add some conditional logic or otherwise modify the way the template behaves or is rendered. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The NgClass directive is able to add or remove CSS classes to and from the element. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The safe navigation operator ?. will silently fail and not display anything if the property is missing. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Pipes, which are added directly into the expression to format the output.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Pipes only modify the data before it is displayed, and do not change the value in the controller. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Input annotation. This indicates that this property is to be provided to the component by a parent component passing it to the summary.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The host selector is a way to specify that you want the styles to apply to the element that hosts the element </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="components-that-use-components-and-services">Components that use components and services</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The constructor method runs as soon as the component is created.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Don&#x2019;t load data from the service in the constructor </p>
</li>
<li><p>Components expose a number of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute commands at various stages of rendering, giving you greater control over when things occur. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="components-with-forms-and-events">Components with forms and events</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This doesn&#x2019;t require the OnInit lifecycle hook, because it&#x2019;s a synchronous request to get data that exists in memory. </p>
</li>
<li><p>(submit)=&quot;add()&quot; is an event binding. </p>
</li>
<li><p>[(ngModel)]=&quot;stock&quot; attribute is a two-way binding that will sync the value of the input and the value of the property in the controller anytime it changes from either location. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="application-routing">Application routing</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Routing, configures the different pages that the application can render </p>
</li>
<li><p>The router works by declaring an outlet in the template, which is the place in the template that the final rendered component will be displayed.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Angular apps are components that contain a tree of components. The root app is bootstrapped on page load to initialize the application.</li>
<li>A component is an ES6 class with an @Component annotation that adds metadata to the class for Angular to properly render it. </li>
<li><p>Directives are attributes that modify the template in some way, such as NgIf, which conditionally shows or hides the DOM element based on the value of an expression. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Routing in Angular is based around paths mapping to a component. Routes will render a single component, and that component will also be able to render any additional components it needs. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-app-essentials">3 App essentials</h2>
<h3 id="entities-in-angular">Entities in Angular</h3>
<ul>
<li>These different entities have specific roles and capabilities, and you&#x2019;ll be using them in various combinations to create your application. Here is a quick overview of the types: <ul>
<li>Modules&#x2014;Objects that help you to organize dependencies into discrete units</li>
<li>Components&#x2014;New elements that will compose the majority of your application&#x2019;s structure and logic</li>
<li>Directives&#x2014;Objects that modify elements to give them new capabilities or change behaviors</li>
<li>Pipes&#x2014;Functions that format data before it&#x2019;s rendered</li>
<li>Services&#x2014;Reusable objects that fill niche roles such as data access or helper utilities </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Modules are buckets for storing related entities for easy reuse and distribution. </p>
</li>
<li><p>JavaScript modules are language constructs and are a way to separate code into different files that can be loaded as needed. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Angular modules are logical constructs used for organizing similar groups of entities </p>
</li>
<li><p>The @NgModule decorator contains the metadata for the App module, and the empty class acts as the vessel for storing the data. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The declarations array contains a list of all components and directives that the application&#x2019;s main module wants to make available to the entire application. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The providers array contains a list of all of the services that you want to make available to the whole application. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The imports array contains a list of the other modules that this module depends upon. </p>
</li>
<li><p>To start rendering, Angular also needs to know what component(s) to render on the screen, and it looks at the bootstrap array for this list. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A component is an encapsulated element that maintains its own internal logic for how it desires to render some output </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here are the key principles of a component:<ul>
<li>Encapsulation&#x2014;Keep component logic isolated</li>
<li>Isolation&#x2014;Keep component internals hidden</li>
<li>Reusability&#x2014;Allow component reuse with minimal effort</li>
<li>Event-based&#x2014;Emit events during the lifecycle of the component</li>
<li>Customizable&#x2014;Possible to style and extend the component</li>
<li>Declarative&#x2014;Component used with simple declarative markup </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Dashboard component holds the data for all the stocks and binds that information into the individual Summary components. Each Summary component uses the provided stock data to display itself. Any changes in the dashboard data will cause the child Summary components to be updated. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Angular favors putting logic and capabilities straight into the HTML markup of the application </p>
</li>
<li><p>NgIf gives an element the ability to conditionally render or be removed </p>
</li>
<li><p>There are three categories of directives: attribute directives, structural directives, and components. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Attribute directives (NgClass) modify the appearance or behavior of an element. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Structural directives (NgIf , NgFor) modify the DOM tree based on some conditions.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The primary default directives provided by Angular consist of the following:<ul>
<li>NgClass&#x2014;Conditionally apply a class to an element</li>
<li>NgStyle&#x2014;Conditionally apply a set of styles to an element</li>
<li>NgIf&#x2014;Conditionally insert or remove an element from the DOM</li>
<li>NgFor&#x2014;Iterate over a collection of items</li>
<li>NgSwitch&#x2014;Conditionally display an item from a set of options </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pipes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using pipes, we can transform the data in the view during rendering without changing the underlying data value. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reuse functional pieces of JavaScript logic across your application. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-angular-begins-to-render-an-app">How Angular begins to render an app</h3>
<p><img src="../img/How Angular renders the base app into the browser.png"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately upon loading the page, the bootstrapper is called to begin Angular execution. </p>
</li>
<li><p>It loads your App module and reads through any additional dependencies that need to be loaded and bootstrapped. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Renders the App component, which is the root element of your application. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Any child components are also rendered as part of the component tree.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>It will also resolve bindings and set up event listeners for anything that declares it. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-compilers">Types of compilers</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Angular provides two types of compilers, called the Just-in-Time (JiT) compiler and the Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compiler </p>
</li>
<li><p>With JiT compilation, it means that the compiling of the application happens in the browser only after the assets have all been loaded. </p>
</li>
<li><p>AoT, is a way to render the content before sending it to the browser.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dependency-injection">Dependency injection</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Dependency injection (DI) is a pattern for obtaining objects that uses a registry to maintain a list of available objects and a service that allows you to request the object you need. Rather than having to pass around objects, you can ask for what you need when you need it. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Injector. This is the service that Angular provides for requesting and registering dependencies </p>
</li>
<li><p>Providers are responsible for creating the instanceof the object requested. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="change-detection">Change detection</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Change detection is the mechanism for keeping data and the rendered views in sync with one another. Changes always come down from the model into the view, and Angular employs a unidirectional propagation of changes from parents down to children. This helps ensure that if a parent changes, any children are also checked, due to potential linked data. </p>
</li>
<li><p>JavaScript has no guaranteed way to notify about any change to an object, so Angular runs this process instead. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When a value change is detected in a component, it will update the component and potentially any child components as well.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Angular has two ways for changes to be triggered. The Default mode will traverse the entire tree looking for changes with each change detection process. The OnPush mode tells Angular that the component only cares about changes to any values that are input into the component from its parent, and gives Angular the ability to skip checking the component during change detection if it already knows the parent hasn&#x2019;t changed. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Change detection is triggered by either events, receiving HTTP responses, or timers intervals. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Change detection is the mechanism that allows components to be updated when data changes in a parent component, and ensure views and data are in sync. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="template-expressions-and-bingdings">Template expressions and bingdings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Angular allows the placement of logic and customization directly into the template </p>
</li>
<li><p>Template concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpolation&#x2014;Displaying content in the page</li>
<li>Attribute and property bindings&#x2014;Linking data from the component controller into attributes or properties of other elements</li>
<li>Event bindings&#x2014;Adding event listeners to elements</li>
<li>Directives&#x2014;Modifying the behavior or adding additional structure to elements</li>
<li>Pipes&#x2014;Formatting data before it&#x2019;s displayed on the page </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Template expressions are used in three places: for interpolation, property bindings, and event bindings. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Bindings are the conduit for data or methods to be used from a controller in the template; they allow data in the controller to &#xFB02;ow into the template, or events to call from the template back into the controller. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Property bindings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>property bindings, which allow you to bind values to properties of an element to modify their behavior or appearance. </p>
</li>
<li><p>As with interpolation, the bindings are evaluated in the component context, so the binding will reference properties of the controller. </p>
</li>
<li><p>interpolation is a shortcut for a property binding to the textContent property of an element.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Using the [] syntax binds to an element&#x2019;s property, not the attribute. This is an important distinction, because properties are the DOM element&#x2019;s property. That makes it possible to use any valid HTML element property (such as the img src property). Instead of binding the data to the attribute, you&#x2019;re binding data directly to the element property, which is quite efficient </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>An Angular application is a tree of components, and there is always a root application component.</li>
<li>The various entity types (modules, components, directives, pipes, services) each have a specific role and purpose.</li>
<li>Angular has two types of compilers, Ahead-of-Time (AoT) and Just-in-Time (JiT), to give you different ways to render the application.</li>
<li>Dependency injection is fundamental for Angular to track all the objects in the application and make them available when they&#x2019;re requested.</li>
<li>Change detection keeps the components in sync with the model data as asynchronous changes occur from user input or other events.</li>
<li>Templates contain several types of bindings: interpolation for displaying data, property bindings for modifying the element&#x2019;s properties, attribute bindings for modifying non-property values of an element, and event bindings for handling events. </li>

<h3 id="composition-and-lifecycle-of-a-component">Composition and lifecycle of a component</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Components have a lifecycle that begins with their initial instantiation, and continues with their rendering until they&#x2019;re destroyed and removed from the application. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Concepts that compose and in&#xFB02;uence a component&#x2019;s behavior </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/component behavior.png" alt="component behavior"></p>
<ul>
<li>Here&#x2019;s a list of the primary things that compose a component:<ul>
<li>Component Metadata Decorator &#x2014;All components must be annotated with the @Component() decorator to properly register the component with Angular. The metadata contains numerous properties to help modify the way the component behaves or is rendered.</li>
<li>Controller&#x2014;The controller is the class that is decorated with @Component(), and it contains all the properties and methods for the component. Most of the logic exists in the controller.</li>
<li>Template&#x2014;A component isn&#x2019;t a component without a template. The markup for a component defnes the layout and content of the UI that a user can see, and the rendered version of the template will look at the values from the controller to bind any </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Component lifecycle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Component lifecycle while the application is running </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/Component lifecycle.png" alt="component behavior"></p>
<ul>
<li>The component metadata will then be fully processed by Angular, including the parsing of the component template, styles, and bindings. If the template contains any child components, those will kick off the same lifecycle for those components as well, but they won&#x2019;t block this component from continuing to render. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lifecycle hooks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lifecycle hooks aren&#x2019;t like event listeners&#x2014;they&#x2019;re special methods with specifc names that are called during the component&#x2019;s lifecycle if they&#x2019;re defned. </li>
<li>Lifecycle hook<ul>
<li>OnChanges: Fires any time the input bindings have changed</li>
<li>OnInit: This runs once after the component has fully initialized</li>
<li>OnDestroy: Before a component is completely removed, the OnDestroy hook allows you to run some logic. </li>
<li>DoCheck: Any time that change detection runs to determine whether the application needs to be updated </li>
<li>AfterContentInit: When any content children have been fully initialized, this hook will allow you to do any initial work </li>

<li>AfterViewInit: This hook lets you run logic after all View Children have been initially rendered. </li>
<li>AfterViewChecked: When Angular checks the component view and any View Children have been checked</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nesting components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any component that&#x2019;s nested inside another&#x2019;s template is called a View Child</li>
<li>Occasionally a component accepts content to be inserted into its template, and this is known as a Content Child</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-components">Types of components</h3>
<ul>
<li>Here are the four roles of components <ul>
<li>App component&#x2014;This is the root app component, and you only get one of these per application.</li>
<li>Display component&#x2014;This is a stateless component that re&#xFB02;ects the values passed into it, making it highly reusable.</li>
<li>Data component&#x2014;This is a component that helps get data into the application by loading it from external sources.</li>
<li>Route component&#x2014;When using the router, each route will render a component, and this makes the component intrinsically linked to the route. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>App component</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Here are the guidelines I recommend for your App component: <ul>
<li>Keep it simple &#x2014;If possible, don&#x2019;t put any logic into the component. Think of it more like a container. It&#x2019;s easier to reuse and optimize the rest of your components if the App component doesn&#x2019;t have complex behaviors they depend upon.</li>
<li>Use for application layout scaffolding&#x2014;The template is the primary part of the component, and you&#x2019;ll see later in this chapter how we create the primary application layout in this component.</li>
<li>Avoid loading data&#x2014;Usually you will avoid loading data in this component, because I like to load data closer to the component that uses that data. You might load some global data (perhaps something like a user session), though that could also be done separately. On less complex applications, you might load data because it&#x2019;s more complicated to abstract it on smaller applications. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Display component </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Here are the primary guidelines I suggest for a Display component: <ul>
<li>Decouple&#x2014;Ensure that the component has no real coupling to other components, except that data may be passed into it as an input when requested.</li>
<li>Make it only as &#xFB02;exible as necessary&#x2014;Avoid making these components overly complex and adding a lot of confguration and options out of the box. Over time, you might enhance them, but I fnd it&#x2019;s best to start simple and add later.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t load data&#x2014;Always accept data through an input binding instead of loading data dynamically through HTTP or through a service.</li>
<li>Have a clean API &#x2014;Accept input bindings to obtain data into the component and emit events for any actions that need to be pushed back up to other components.</li>
<li>Optionally use a service for confguration&#x2014;Sometimes you may need to provide confguration defaults, and instead of having to declare the preferences with every use of the component, you can use a service that sets application defaults.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The more encapsulated and isolated the component is, the easier it will be to reuse. </li>
<li>I often fnd that when I start to refactor some code, I begin by identifying individual aspects of my code that could be standalone display components. I might notice a lot of repeated snippets of code that mostly have the same capabilities and refactor them into a single component. It&#x2019;s also common for these components to have a template and little to no logic in the controller. That&#x2019;s perfectly acceptable, because it allows you to easily reuse a template snippet across your application. </li>
<li>It&#x2019;s also common for these components to have a template and little to no logic in the controller. That&#x2019;s perfectly acceptable, because it allows you to easily reuse a template snippet across your application. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data component</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data components are primarily about handling, retrieving, or accepting data. Typically, they rely on a service to handle the loading of data. Here are some considerations for a Data component: <ul>
<li>Use appropriate lifecycle hooks&#x2014;To do the initial data loading, always leverage the best lifecycle hook for when to trigger the loading or persistence of data. We&#x2019;ll look at this more later in this chapter.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t worry about reusability&#x2014;These components are not likely to be reused because they have a special role to manage data, which is diffcult to decouple.</li>
<li>Set up display components&#x2014;Think about how this component can load data needed by other display components and handle any data from user interactions.</li>
<li>Isolate business logic inside&#x2014;This can be a great place to store your application business logic, because anytime you manage data, you&#x2019;re likely dealing with a specialized implementation that works for a specifc use case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Route component</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A route component should primarily follow these guidelines: <ul>
<li>Template scaffolding for the route&#x2014;The route will render this component, so this is the most logical place to put the template that&#x2019;s associated with the route.</li>
<li>Load data or rely on data components&#x2014;Depending on the complexity of your route, the route component may load data for the route or rely on one or more data components to do that for it. If you&#x2019;re unsure, I&#x2019;d suggest loading data initially in the Route component and decoupling as your view gets more complex.</li>
<li>Handles route parameters&#x2014;As you navigate, there are likely to be router parameters (such as the ID of the content item being viewed), and this is the best place to handle those parameters, which often determine what content to load from the back end. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-advanced-components">5 Advanced components</h2>
<h3 id="change-detection-and-optimizations">Change detection and optimizations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Angular ships with a change detection framework that determines when components need to be rendered if inputs have changed. Components need to react to changes made somewhere in the component tree, and the way they change is through inputs. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes are always triggered by some asynchronous activity, such as when a user interacts with the page. When these changes occur, there is a chance (though no guarantee) that the application state or data has changed. Here are some examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>A user clicks a button to trigger a form submission (user activity).</li>
<li>An interval fres every x seconds to refresh data (intervals or timers).</li>
<li>Callbacks, observables, or promises are resolved (XHR requests, event streams). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Change detection starts at the top and goes down the tree by default, or with OnPush only goes down the tree with changed inputs. </p>
<p><img src="../img/Change detection.png" alt="Change detection"></p>
</li>
<li><p>There&#x2019;s another way to intercept and detect changes using the OnChanges lifecycle hook </p>
</li>
<li><p>We still need to declare our input properties, so we go back to the previous way to declare them without the getter and setter methods. The ngOnChanges method implements the lifecycle hook for OnChanges, and it provides a single parameter as an object populated with any changed inputs, which then have their current and previous values available. For example, if only the value input was changed in the parent, then only the change.value property will be set on the lifecycle hook. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../img/output event.png" alt="output event"></p>
<p><strong>View Child to reference components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ViewChild is a decorator for a controller property, like Inject or Output, which tells Angular to fll in that property with a reference to a specifc child component controller. It&#x2019;s limited to injecting only children, so if you try to inject a component that isn&#x2019;t a direct descendent, it will provide you with an undefned value. </li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-ts"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { Component, ViewChild } from <span class="hljs-string">&apos;@angular/core&apos;</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { DashboardComponent } from <span class="hljs-string">&apos;./dashboard/dashboard.component&apos;</span>;
@Component({
    selector: <span class="hljs-string">&apos;app-root&apos;</span>,
    templateUrl: <span class="hljs-string">&apos;./app.component.html&apos;</span>,
    styleUrls: [<span class="hljs-string">&apos;./app.component.css&apos;</span>]
})
<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> AppComponent {
    @ViewChild(DashboardComponent) dashboard: DashboardComponent;
    refresh() {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.dashboard.generateData();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If you ever need to do anything more than access properties or methods of a child controller, you probably need to use the ViewChild approach. This does cause a coupling between the two components, which should be avoided when possible. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="styling-components-and-encapsulation-modes">Styling components and encapsulation modes</h3>
<p><strong>Adding styles to a component</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Here we have a simple component that has styling applied from fve different approaches: <ul>
<li>Global CSS rules</li>
<li>Inline CSS style element</li>
<li>Inline style declaration</li>
<li>Component styles property</li>
<li>Component styleUrls property linked to a CSS fle </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Encapsulation modes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>One key capability is the ability to ensure that CSS styling for a component doesn&#x2019;t bleed over into the rest of the app, which is called styling encapsulation.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Angular comes with three encapsulation modes for a view. </p>
<ul>
<li>None&#x2014;No encapsulation is used during rendering of the view, and the component DOM is subject to the normal rules of CSS. Templates aren&#x2019;t modifed when injected into the app except for the removal of any CSS style elements from the template to the document head.</li>
<li>Emulated&#x2014;Emulated encapsulation is used to simulate styling encapsulation by adding unique CSS selectors to your CSS rules at runtime. CSS can cascade into the component easily from the global CSS rules.</li>
<li>Native&#x2014;Uses the native Shadow DOM for styling and markup encapsulation and provides the best encapsulation. All styles are injected inside the shadow root and are therefore localized to the component. None of the templates or styles declared for the component are visible outside the component. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dynamically rendering components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are a few fairly common situations that you&#x2019;ve seen where a dynamic component is often a good solution. For example <ul>
<li>Modals that display over the page with dynamic content</li>
<li>Alerts that conditionally display</li>
<li>Carousel or tabs that might dynamically expand the amount of content</li>
<li>Collapsible content that needs to be removed afterward </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-services">6 Services</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shared code across your application is almost always best placed inside of a service. In Angular, most of the time a service also is something that you can inject into your
controllers using dependency injection, though there is no exact defnition of what makes an object a service. </li>
<li>Service roles<ul>
<li>Injectable services are the typical Angular services that provide a feature for the
application and work with Angular&#x2019;s DI system to be injected into components. An example would be a service that handles how to load data from an API.</li>
<li>Non-injectable services are JavaScript objects that aren&#x2019;t tied into Angular&#x2019;s DI system and are just imported into the fle. This can be useful to make a service available outside of Angular&#x2019;s DI, such as in the application&#x2019;s main fle.</li>
<li>Helper services are services that make it easier to use a component or feature. An example would be a service to help manage the currently active alert on the page.</li>
<li>Data services are for sharing data across the application. An example is an object holding data for the logged-in user. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependency injection and injector trees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we want to use DI instead of regular module loading in JavaScript? There are a few key reasons you&#x2019;ll usually want to make your services injectable: <ul>
<li>It allows you to focus on consuming services and not worry about how to create them.</li>
<li>It resolves external dependencies for you, simplifying consumption.</li>
<li>It&#x2019;s easier to test your Angular entities because you can always inject a mock service instead of the real thing.</li>
<li>It can allow you to control the injection of a service without having to worry about where another piece of the application might also inject the service.</li>
<li>It gives you a clean instance of the service for each injector tree. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DI is powerful and is vital for our applications to be easy to manage, but keeping up with the nuances can be a little challenging if you try to combine these capabilities all of the time. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when it comes to DI and services: <ul>
<li>Inject at the lowest level&#x2014;Instead of adding everything to the App module providers array, try to add it to the lowest component providers array. This will minimize the &#x201C;surface area&#x201D; of your service to only be available to the components that might use it.</li>
<li>Name your services wisely&#x2014;Give your services semantic and meaningful names. PostsService might be clear enough, or perhaps BlogPostsService, depending on the context. I fnd it&#x2019;s easier to type a few more characters than it is to guess what a service named BPService might be, especially when multiple people are working on your application.</li>
<li>Keep services focused&#x2014;Rather than creating one mega service that you inject everywhere with lots of abilities, make a sensible number of services that do specifc tasks. The longer your service is, the harder it is to maintain and test, and it will likely become tangled in your application.</li>
<li>Keep services meaningful&#x2014;On the &#xFB02;ip side of keeping services focused, you&#x2019;ll need to balance the utility of adding another service. Do you need a service for something that&#x2019;s used only once? It may add more complexity for little beneft, so strike the right balance between number of services and their roles.</li>
<li>Use consistent patterns&#x2014;Follow the same design for your services for consistency. For example, if you have several services that handle making REST API calls, you&#x2019;d likely want to give them the same kinds of methods, like get to load an object, or save to store a record. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using the HttpClient service</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>t&#x2019;s considered best practice to never use HttpClient in the component controller directly (yet many articles and even the documentation may demonstrate this case), because this helps create a separation of concerns. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ll create a new service that will use the HttpClient service and abstract some of the logic from the controller. </li>
<li>Often you&#x2019;ll want to intercept HTTP requests or responses before they&#x2019;re handled elsewhere in the application. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Helper services</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you build your application, you may see some code start to reappear in various places. That&#x2019;s what all services help to reduce, but sometimes you&#x2019;ll fnd that some
code feels out of place and needs to be extracted into a service. When you do that, you&#x2019;re creating a service that exposes helper functions to simplify your components.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Services are best for taking on specifc tasks, such as data access and managing confguration.</li>
<li>Services can be injected anywhere in the application as long as they&#x2019;ve been registered with a provider.</li>
<li>Angular provides an HttpClient service that helps manage making XHR requests, and you can wrap your own services around it to simplify data access.</li>
<li>Services can hold values that get propagated, but you need to be aware of the injection tree to avoid getting different copies of the service.</li>
<li>A class could be used like a service, without having to use dependency injection, but it should be limited to only situations that make sense.</li>
<li>Angular exposes many entities in the API that you can use in your application, such as a Location service for managing URLs. </li>
